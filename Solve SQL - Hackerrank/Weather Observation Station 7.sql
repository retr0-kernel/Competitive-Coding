/*In the context of regular expressions used in the SQL statements above, "^" and "$" are special characters that match the beginning and end of a string, respectively.

"^" (caret) is a special character that matches the beginning of a string. In the modified SQL statement "WHERE CITY REGEXP '^[AEIOU]'", the "^" character matches the beginning of the "CITY" column value and ensures that only the values that start with a vowel are selected.

"$" (dollar sign) is a special character that matches the end of a string. In the original SQL statement "WHERE CITY REGEXP '[AEIOU]$'", the "$" character matches the end of the "CITY" column value and ensures that only the values that end with a vowel are selected.

So, the main difference between "^" and "$" is that "^" matches the beginning of a string, while "$" matches the end of a string.*/

SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION WHERE CITY REGEXP '[AEIOU]$'
